This page provides the LOFAR data used in the work: Searching for Ultralight Dark Matter Conversion in Solar Corona using Low Frequency Array Data (arXiv: 2301.03622).

The data originally came from https://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/eduard/lofar_data/ which is publicly accessible. However, data may occasionally be added or removed from that website. So we build this page to store the data we used for our work.
